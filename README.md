# üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
Analysing campaign and sales data, this project seeks to provide insights into campaign effectiveness, customer behaviour and overall business health. 

Analysis done in R and visual representations of key findings were developed in Power BI


# ‚ÅâÔ∏è Analysis

    * Customer acquisition contribution
    * Revenue, orders and profits
3. Sales and Profitability:
    * Revenue, profit margins and YoY performance
   * Regional comparison of the same to determine top performing regions and those needing more attention

# üìëInsights
**1. Acquisition VS Retention Imbalance:**
  * 2021 saw a customer growth rate of 245.7% an indicator of succesful marketing strategy
  * Overall Retention rate was extremely low at 13% an indicator that most customers stopped engaging after their initial interaction
  * USA had the highest growth rate. Australia had the highest retention rate at 21%    

While customer acquisition strategies were highly effective, the low retention rates points to issues with customer satisfaction, product/service quality or post-purchase engagement resulting in unsustainable growth and increased marketing costs.

**2. Campaign Effectiveness:**
   * Google-ads proved to be the best marketing campaign by number of customers, orders and revenue across all regions, followed by Meta-ads and finally Yt-campaign
   * Google-ads had the highest retention rate at 11% as compared to 1% and 2% for Meta-ads and Yt-campaign respectively.
   * Google-ads and Meta-ads both recorded a decrease in revenue by 1.8% and 4.5% respectively and a decrease in profit by 2.3% and 4.5% respectively

**3. Sales Performance:**
  * Revenue grew by 45.2% while profits grew by 52.1% for financial year 2021
  * Canada was the only country recording a decrease in revenue and profits by 15.2% and 4.9% respectively.
  * *Pots* was the only product category that experienced a decrease in revenue and profits.

# üí°Recommendations
1. Balance Marketing Investments:
Shift focus from purely acquisition-centric campaigns to include nurturing and retaining customers for long-term profitability.

2. Investigate product or service issues contributing to low retention rates, especially in regions with poor performance.

3. Address the declining sales performance in Canada and evaluate market-specific challenges.

4. Review product strategies for the "Plants" category to identify demand or supply chain issues.
